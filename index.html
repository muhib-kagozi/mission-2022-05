                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>How does a designer know what words to display, how pages should be organized, or what pages should
                    exist
                    in the first place? These things aren't mysteries. They all come from a vision statement â€” a
                    document
                    that lays out the core scope and purpose of the site.</p>

            <p class="without-limits-paragraph">The importance of self-improvement often goes unnoticed. We are either
                conveniently brushing our
                shortcomings under the carpet, refusing to face them or are just happy being ignorant. Truth is - you
                cannot run away from yourself. The farther you run, the deeper a grave you dig because there will come a
                time when all those unresolved emotions will surface, leaving you overwhelmed.</p>
